# Customer-Analysis on Retail Data 
The purpose of the study is to analyse the below points:
Customer Behaviour
Customer segmentation
Cohort Analysis for customer retention
Frequently purchased products
Since the dataset of other countries are fairly small hence most of the analysis was restricted to  UK. 
UK region also has data only for a time period of one year. 
The analysis could be extended to include a classification model for the customer segmentation.
An Anomaly detection model can also be build and studied month on month to understand if any fraud transactions.
SMOTE method can be used to generate more data points for other countries in order to build more robust analysis for countries other than UK.
